OOM when allocating tensor with shape[16,52,52,128] and type float on /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0 by allocator cpu
	 [[{{node gradient_tape/sequential_1/batch_normalization_2_1/moments/sub}}]]
Hint: If you want to see a list of allocated tensors when OOM happens, add report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom to RunOptions for current allocation info. This isn't available when running in Eager mode.

OOM when allocating tensor with shape[86528,256] and type float on /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0 by allocator cpu
	 [[{{node adam/Sub_50}}]]
Hint: If you want to see a list of allocated tensors when OOM happens, add report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom to RunOptions for current allocation info. This isn't available when running in Eager mode.

OOM when allocating tensor with shape[12,1024,576] and type float on /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0 by allocator cpu
	 [[{{node gradient_tape/sequential_1/conv2d_1_2/convolution/Conv2DBackpropFilter}}]]
Hint: If you want to see a list of allocated tensors when OOM happens, add report_tensor_allocations_upon_oom to RunOptions for current allocation info. This isn't available when running in Eager mode.
